#  React Firebase Auth App

This is a baisc React-firebase authentication app in which user can login with google or any email Id can signup to view his profile and other users who have logged in(Basically privated route is also setuped) . I have used material-UI for styling the content and used firestore as the database and hosted in firebase.

### `npm install`

This is done to install the node modules

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
